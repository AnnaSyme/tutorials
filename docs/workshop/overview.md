# Overview

In this section there are five short tutorials covering basic microbial genomics analyses in Galaxy. These have been designed to run sequentially.

1. [Use the Galaxy Platform](genomics/1a/index.md): a web-based interface for bioinformatic analyses.
2. [View genomes with JBrowse](genomics/1b/index.md): view bacterial genomes with JBrowse.
3. [Assemble genomes with Spades](genomics/2a/index.md): assemble raw sequence reads into a draft bacterial genome sequence using the tool "Spades".
4. [Annotate genomes with Prokka](genomics/2b/index.md): describe the type and location of proteins and other features on the draft bacterial genome sequence using the tool "Prokka".
5. [Find variants with Snippy](genomics/3b/index.md): identify differences (such as nucleotide mutations) between genomes using the tool "Snippy".
