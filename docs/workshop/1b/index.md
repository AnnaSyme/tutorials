# Getting Started with Artemis

## Background

Artemis is a genome browser and annotation tool. Artemis is written in
java and can be used on Mac, Linux or Windows. While it can be used to
view any genomic data, it is specifically designed for viewing bacterial
or viral genomes. A variety of file types can be loaded and viewed using
Artemis, these include fasta, multifasta, EMBL, GenBank and GFF format
files.

## Objectives

1.  Be able to install Artemis on your laptop
2.  Be able to download a bacterial genome sequence
3.  Be able open the genome sequence in Artemis and navigate
    the sequence.

## Section 1: Installing Artemis

Artemis is available at no cost from the Sanger Institute Website.
Instructions for downloading and installing Artemis can be found at:

<http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis>

Download and run

Not working? The most common problem: Java is either not installed or
too old.

Artemis needs a recent version of Java v1.6 or higher. Go to java.com
and update

Still not working? Seek help!

## Section 2: Downloading a bacterial genome

Download the sequence of *Leptospira borgpetersenii* serovar Hardjobovis
Chromosome II from the NCBI website in GenBank format.  

Open URL: <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>

Select the “Taxonomy” database

Enter “Leptospira borgpetersenii” in the search box and **Search**
