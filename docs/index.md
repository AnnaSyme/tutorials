# Welcome!

This site contains tutorials for using the
[Microbial Genomics Virtual Lab](http:/genome.edu.au/) to perform bioinformatics
tasks on bacterial "omics" data, either on the Unix command line or using
the [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) system.

!!! note
    The site is under active development. Training modules are being developed
    and added progressively. Please send issues or suggestions
    to [Anna Syme](mailto:anna.syme@gmail.com) at VLSCI.
