This site contains tutorials for using the
[Microbial Genomics Virtual Lab](http:/genome.edu.au/) to perform bioinformatics
tasks on bacterial "omics" data, either on the Unix command line or using
the [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) system.

Tutorials on Assembly and Annotation can be found under the *Microbial Genomics* tab in the top panel.
