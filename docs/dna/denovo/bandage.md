#Bandage

Bandage is a program to visualize a genome assembly.

link: http://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/

##Start

- Open your mGVL dashboard and click on the link to the Lubuntu desktop.

- A web window should appear called "noVNC". This shows the virtual desktop.

- Open the Terminal in this VNC. type in /mnt/gvl/apps/bandage/Bandage. The Bandage window will appear.


##Input data
- Click on **File: Load graph**. Select a graph to upload.

- FIXME: put in example bacterial genome graph with a feature that bandage reveals.  E.g. a fastg output file from Spades.


## Run Bandage
- Under **Graph drawing**, click on **Draw graph**. A map graph of the contigs and their connections will appear.

- FIXME: add a series of steps that can be done that will show some important feature.

E.g.

- **Graph display: Colour by read depth**

- **Node labels**, check box next to **Read depth**.

- select some nodes

- **Output**: **Web BLAST selected nodes**

etc.


##Output
- **Output**: **Save entire graph to GFA**. (FIXME: where does this save; what can you use it for next).
