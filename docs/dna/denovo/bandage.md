# Bandage

Bandage is a program to visualize a genome assembly.

[Link to code on github](http://rrwick.github.io/Bandage/)

## Start
- Open your mGVL dashboard and click on the link to the Lubuntu desktop.
- A web window should appear called "noVNC". This shows the virtual desktop.
- Open the Terminal in this VNC. type in:
```bash
/mnt/gvl/apps/bandage/Bandage
```
The Bandage window will appear.

## Input data
- Click on <ss>File: Load graph</ss>. Select a graph to upload.
- FIXME: put in example bacterial genome graph with a feature that bandage reveals.  E.g. a FASTG output file from Spades.

## Run Bandage
- Under <ss>Graph drawing<ss>, click on <ss>Draw graph<ss>. A map graph of the contigs and their connections will appear.
- FIXME: add a series of steps that can be done that will show some important feature.
E.g.
- <ss>Graph display: Colour by read depth</ss>
- <ss>Node labels</ss>, check box next to <ss>Read depth</ss>.
- select some nodes
- <ss>Output</ss>: <ss>Web BLAST selected nodes</ss>
etc.

## Output
- <ss>Output</ss>: <ss>Save entire graph to GFA</ss>. (FIXME: where does this save; what can you use it for next).
